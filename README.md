# GBactPro_Pipeline

Repository for the GBactPro pipeline: a genome-wide bacterial promoter prediction framework.

This repository contains the official implementation and documentation for GBactPro. The project aims to make promoter prediction transparent, reproducible, and accessible to researchers.

What you'll find here

- Example input data: small-scale sequences and minimal metadata to quickly test the pipeline and validate the end-to-end workflow.
- Reproducibility resources: processed datasets, example scripts, and small helper utilities to partially reproduce results reported in the GBactPro publication.
- Documentation: step-by-step Markdown guides covering installation, usage, workflow diagrams, and notes on interpreting outputs.

Goals

- Provide a clear, runnable implementation of GBactPro.
- Share data and code needed to reproduce key analyses.
- Offer accessible documentation so users can adapt the pipeline to new bacterial genomes.

How to get started

1. Clone the repository (or use the folder created locally):

   git clone https://github.com/ximenahan/GBactPro_Pipeline.git

2. Inspect the `docs/` and `examples/` folders for usage notes and sample data.

3. Follow the step-by-step guides in the `docs/` directory to run preprocessing, training (if provided), and genome scanning.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open issues or pull requests on GitHub. If you plan to reproduce figures from the manuscript, include a short notebook or script showing the steps.
